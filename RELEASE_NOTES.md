# Release v1.0.0 – First Edition - The Founders' Collection

This is the initial version of the Horn of Africa Aviary field guide, published as a GitHub Release (tagged `v1.0.0`). It includes the first three species entries that form the foundation of the guide.

## Included Species

1. **Secretarybird** (*Sagittarius serpentarius*) – The iconic terrestrial raptor of the open savannas.
2. **Bateleur** (*Terathopius ecaudatus*) – The acrobatic eagle of woodlands and scrub.
3. **Vulturine Guineafowl** (*Acryllium vulturinum*) – The striking, social guineafowl of arid bushlands.

## What’s New

- Standardized species‑entry template (`species_entry_template.md`)
- Detailed entries for each of the three founder species
- Repository structure with `entries/` directory
- Project overview and contribution guidelines in `README.md`

## Future Work

The following tasks are planned and tracked as GitHub Issues:

- **Add entry for the Wattled Ibis** – Research its adaptation to high‑altitude environments and its presence in local rock art.
- **Research: The Hammerkop in Folklore** – Gather and summarize at least three distinct folk tales or beliefs about the Hammerkop from different cultures within the Horn of Africa.
