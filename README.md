# Horn of Africa Aviary Project

A collaborative digital field guide for the birds of the Horn of Africa, combining ornithology with cultural history.

## Project Goal

This project aims to create a detailed, accessible, and community‑driven field guide to the birdlife of the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and parts of Kenya and Sudan). Each entry not only documents the species’ identification, habitat, and behavior, but also explores its significance in local folklore, art, literature, and history—reflecting the rich interplay between nature and human culture in the region.

## Structure

- **`species_entry_template.md`** – A standard template for all bird entries.
- **`entries/`** – Directory containing individual Markdown files for each species.
- **`README.md`** – This overview.
- **Issues & Pull Requests** – Used to coordinate contributions, research tasks, and updates.

## How to Contribute

1.  Review the template to understand the expected format.
2.  Open an issue to propose a new species entry or a cultural/historical research task.
3.  Fork the repository, create a new branch, and add your entry following the template.
4.  Submit a pull request with a clear description of what you’ve added.
5.  Once reviewed and merged, the entry becomes part of the guide.

## Current Status

The project is in its early stages. The first edition (v1.0.0) includes three foundational entries:

- Secretarybird
- Bateleur
- Vulturine Guineafowl

Check the `entries/` directory for the complete list, and see the open issues for planned additions.
