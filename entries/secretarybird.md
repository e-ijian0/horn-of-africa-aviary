# Secretarybird

**Scientific Name:** *Sagittarius serpentarius*

**Conservation Status:** Vulnerable (IUCN Red List)

## Identification

The Secretarybird is a large, terrestrial raptor standing 1.2–1.4 m tall with a wingspan of 1.9–2.2 m. Its most distinctive features are the long, crane‑like legs, a grey‑white body, black flight feathers, and a crest of elongated black feathers that resemble quills behind the head (giving the bird its name). The face is bare with orange‑red skin around the eyes, and the hooked bill is pale grey. Sexes are similar, though females are slightly smaller. Juveniles have shorter crests and duller facial skin.

## Habitat & Distribution in the Horn of Africa

Prefers open grasslands, savannas, and lightly wooded plains. In the Horn of Africa, it occurs widely in the Ethiopian Highlands, the Somali arid bushlands, and the savannas of Eritrea, Djibouti, and northern Kenya. It avoids dense forest and true desert. Although largely sedentary, local movements may follow rainfall and prey availability.

## Behavior & Diet

A solitary or paired hunter that walks deliberately across the landscape, often covering more than 20 km per day. It feeds mainly on large insects (especially grasshoppers and beetles), small mammals, lizards, and famously snakes (including venomous species). Prey is killed by rapid, powerful stomps with the feet. The bird is mostly silent but can produce croaking or grunting calls during courtship or aggression. Nests are large platforms of sticks built in low trees or thorny acacias.

## Cultural Significance & Historical Notes

In ancient Egyptian iconography, a bird resembling the Secretarybird sometimes appears as a hieroglyphic symbol associated with protection or the god Thoth (though this identification is debated). Among several pastoralist communities in Ethiopia and Somalia, the bird is respected as a “snake‑killer” and is believed to bring good fortune to households. Its image has been used on postage stamps of Ethiopia and Somalia, reflecting its status as an emblem of the region’s wildlife. Further research is needed to uncover its role in traditional Somali or Ethiopian poetry and oral tales.
