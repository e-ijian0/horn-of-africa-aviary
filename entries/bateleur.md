# Bateleur

**Scientific Name:** *Terathopius ecaudatus*

**Conservation Status:** Near Threatened (IUCN Red List)

## Identification

A medium‑sized eagle with a wingspan of 1.7–1.9 m and a strikingly short tail that gives the bird its name (French for “tight‑rope walker,” referring to its rocking flight). Adults are mostly black with a chestnut mantle and upperwing‑coverts, bright red facial skin and legs, and a large patch of white on the underwing coverts that is conspicuous in flight. The bill is ivory‑coloured with a black tip. Females are similar but have grey secondary feathers. Juveniles are brown overall with greenish facial skin and take about seven years to attain full adult plumage.

## Habitat & Distribution in the Horn of Africa

Found in open savannas, dry woodlands, and thornbush country. In the Horn, it occurs across the Ethiopian lowlands, the Somali arid zones, Eritrean highland edges, and northern Kenya. It avoids dense forest and true desert, but may wander widely in search of food. Population densities are generally low and declining due to habitat loss and persecution.

## Behavior & Diet

An accomplished aerial acrobat, the Bateleur spends much of the day soaring on thermals, often rocking side‑to‑side as if balancing on a wire. It is both a predator and a scavenger, feeding on a wide variety of small mammals, birds, reptiles, carrion, and even insects. It hunts by low‑level flight or from a perch, striking prey on the ground. Pairs are territorial and perform spectacular mutual soaring displays. The nest is a large stick platform built high in a tree, reused over several years.

## Cultural Significance & Historical Notes

The Bateleur’s dramatic appearance and acrobatic flight have made it a symbol of power and freedom in many African cultures. Among the Maasai of Kenya, its feathers are used in ceremonial headdresses worn by warriors and elders. In Ethiopian tradition, the bird is sometimes called “the king’s eagle” and appears in folk tales as a messenger between the human and spirit worlds. Its image has been adopted as a national emblem on the coat of arms of Zimbabwe (though outside the Horn). Further research is needed to document specific stories or proverbs about the Bateleur in Somali, Oromo, or Amharic oral literature.
