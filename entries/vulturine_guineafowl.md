# Vulturine Guineafowl

**Scientific Name:** *Acryllium vulturinum*

**Conservation Status:** Least Concern (IUCN Red List)

## Identification

The largest and most striking of the guineafowl, measuring 60–70 cm in length. It has a bare blue head and neck reminiscent of a vulture, a black “cape” of elongated hackles on the nape and upper back, and a body covered in dense black‑and‑white spotting that gives a scaled appearance. The breast is deep blue, the wings are short and rounded, and the tail is relatively long. Sexes are similar, though males are slightly larger and have longer hackles. Juveniles are duller with less distinct spotting.

## Habitat & Distribution in the Horn of Africa

Inhabits dry savannas, acacia bushland, and semi‑desert scrub. Within the Horn, it is widespread in the arid lowlands of Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, and northern Kenya. It avoids true desert and dense woodland, but may visit waterholes regularly. The species is generally sedentary, though local movements can occur in response to rainfall and food availability.

## Behavior & Diet

Highly social, forming flocks of 20–30 individuals (sometimes up to 100) that move together while foraging. Feeds mainly on seeds, shoots, tubers, and a variety of invertebrates, including termites and beetles. It scratches the ground like other gallinaceous birds and is most active in the early morning and late afternoon. Roosts communally in trees or dense thickets. The call is a loud, repetitive “kek‑kek‑kek” often given when alarmed. Nests are shallow scrapes on the ground, hidden under vegetation.

## Cultural Significance & Historical Notes

The Vulturine Guineafowl’s striking appearance has made it a notable bird in local cultures. Among some Somali pastoralist communities, its feathers are used in traditional adornments and its image appears on handicrafts. In parts of Ethiopia, the bird is sometimes kept as a “watchdog” because its loud alarm calls warn of approaching predators or strangers. There are references to guineafowl in ancient Egyptian art, but it is unclear whether the Vulturine species is depicted. Further research is needed to document its role in folklore, proverbs, or medicinal practices among the Oromo, Afar, and other ethnic groups of the Horn.
